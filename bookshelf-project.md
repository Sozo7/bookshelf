My personal thoughts on the the group project are fairly positive. I feel like we could have achieved more if we were more collaborative in our efforts to plan, discuss, implement and execute our given tasks.  Although the project required our group to come together, we were not given a directive on how those tasks should be worked on by the indivuals within our group.  I feel in cases like these we should of over communicated. Our group communication was poor.

 We needed to communicate more clearly and more frequently. We also could of split up the tasks more evenly in order to bare the burden of responsiblity for the project. I feel this would have helped us work out design issues as well as help the entire group benefit from the learning experience.

 I do want to say that there are most likely parts of this project that could be easily overlooked.  There are areas such as the communication for the standup, helping to debug code, or simple encouragment that I feel were valid contributions along side the physical coding.  

 My takeways from this experience are planning and separation of tasks are key factors to a successful *group sprint*.  I also feel the ability to stay focused on the given directions is vital as well.  We wasted so much time exploring ideas individually that were not vital to the project being successful. I believe it is wisdom to take note of the pitfalls and move forward accordingly.
